HcgBlogGenerator is a NodeJS static site generator for blogs and websites, similar to Jekyll. It processes Markdown files with frontmatter, compiles SCSS to CSS, uses configuration files for site structure, and generates static HTML websites. The app is designed to be used in AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to operate on cloud storage.
